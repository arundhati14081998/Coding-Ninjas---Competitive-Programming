Min. Absolute Difference In Array
Send Feedback
Given an integer array A of size N, find and return the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the array.
We define the absolute difference between two elements ai, and aj (where i != j ) is |ai - aj|.
Input format :
Line 1 : Integer N, Array Size
Line 2 : Array elements (separated by space)
Output Format :
Minimum difference
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^6
Sample Input :
5
2 9 0 4 5
Sample Input :
1
------------
## Read input as specified in the question.
## Print output as specified in the question.
import sys

n=int(input())
arr=list(map(int, input().split()))
arr.sort()
mindiff=sys.maxsize
for i in range(len(arr)-1):
    diff=abs(arr[i]-arr[i+1])
    if (diff<mindiff):
        mindiff = diff
print(mindiff)
